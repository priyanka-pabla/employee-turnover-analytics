# 📌 Employee Turnover Analytics – Machine Learning Project

Predicting **employee turnover** for *Portobello Tech* using machine learning to help HR identify at-risk employees and improve retention.

---

## ✅ Key Objectives

- **Check data quality** & handle missing values  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Cluster employees** who left based on satisfaction & evaluation  
- Handle **class imbalance** using **SMOTE**  
- Train & evaluate models (**Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting**) using **k-fold cross-validation**  
- Recommend **data-driven retention strategies**

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Employees with **low satisfaction** had the highest turnover  
- **High workloads** strongly correlated with leaving  
- Promotions & salary level influenced retention  
- **Clustering analysis** revealed distinct patterns among employees who left

## ⚙️ Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**  
   - Categorical encoding  
   - Feature scaling  
   - SMOTE for class imbalance  

2. **Models Used**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - Gradient Boosting  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-score  
   - ROC-AUC  

4. **Best Model**  
   - Random Forest / Gradient Boosting performed best for predicting at-risk employees

## 🎯 Business Recommendations

- Improve **job satisfaction** through engagement programs  
- Balance **workload** to prevent burnout  
- Provide **promotion pathways** for long-tenure employees  
- Adjust **salary** for low-salary/high-churn groups  
- Offer **skill-building programs**  
- Conduct regular **feedback sessions**
